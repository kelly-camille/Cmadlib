  <h1>Completed MadLib!</h1>
  <p>Today a @Model.Occupation named @Model.Noun4 came to our school to talk to us about her job.    
  </p>
  <p>
    She said the most important skill you need to know to do her job is to be able to @Model.Verb2 around (a) @Model.Adjective @Model.Noun3. 
  </p>
  <p>
    She said it was easy for her to learn her job because she loved to @Model.Verb when she was my age--and that helps a lot!
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're considering her profession, I hope you can be near (a) @Model.Adjective2 @Model.Noun.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's very important! If you get too distracted in that situation you won't be able to @Model.Verb3 next to (a) @Model.Noun2!
